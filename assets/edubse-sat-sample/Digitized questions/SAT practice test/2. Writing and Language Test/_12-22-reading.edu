[[B]]Dark Snow[[/B]]

[[ ]]Most of Greenland’s interior is covered by a thick
layer of ice and compressed snow known as the
Greenland Ice Sheet. The size of the ice sheet fluctuates
seasonally: in summer, average daily high temperatures
in Greenland can rise to slightly above 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, partially melting the ice; in the winter, the
sheet thickens as additional snow falls, and average daily
low temperatures can drop [[12]] [[U]]to as low as 20 degrees[[/U]].

[[ ]]Typically, the ice sheet begins to show evidence of
thawing in late [[13]] [[U]]summer. This follows[[/U]] several weeks of
higher temperatures. [[14]] [[U]]For example,[[/U]] in the summer of
2012, virtually the entire Greenland Ice Sheet underwent
thawing at or near its surface by mid-July, the earliest
date on record. Most scientists looking for the causes of
the Great Melt of 2012 have focused exclusively on rising
temperatures. The summer of 2012 was the warmest in
170 years, records show. But Jason [[15]] [[U]]Box, an associate
professor of geology at Ohio State[[/U]] believes that another
factor added to the early [[16]] [[U]]thaw;[[/U]] the “dark snow”
problem.
[[ ]]According to Box, a leading Greenland expert,
tundra fires in 2012 from as far away as North America
produced great amounts of soot, some [[17]] [[U]]of it[[/U]] drifted
over Greenland in giant plumes of smoke and then
[[18]] [[U]]fell[[/U]] as particles onto the ice sheet. Scientists have long
known that soot particles facilitate melting by darkening
snow and ice, limiting [[19]] [[U]]it’s[[/U]] ability to reflect the Sun’s
rays. As Box explains, “Soot is an extremely powerful
light absorber. It settles over the ice and captures the
Sun’s heat.” The result is a self-reinforcing cycle. As the
ice melts, the land and water under the ice become
exposed, and since land and water are darker than snow,
the surface absorbs even more heat, which [[20]] [[U]] is related
to the rising temperatures.[[/U]]
[[ ]][1] Box’s research is important because the fires of
2012 may not be a one-time phenomenon. [2] According
to scientists, rising Arctic temperatures are making
northern latitudes greener and thus more fire prone.
[3] The pattern Box observed in 2012 may repeat
[[21]] [[U]]itself again,[[/U]] with harmful effects on the Arctic
ecosystem. [4] Box is currently organizing an expedition
to gather this crucial information. [5] The next step for
Box and his team is to travel to Greenland to perform
direct sampling of the ice in order to determine just how
much the soot is contributing to the melting of the ice
sheet. [6] Members of the public will be able to track his
team’s progress—and even help fund the
expedition—through a website Box has created. [[22]]
