[[B]]Whey to Go[[/B]]

[[ ]]Greek yogurt - a strained form of cultured
yogurt - has grown enormously in popularity in the
United States since it was first introduced in the country
in the late 1980s.
[[ ]]From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the
US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in
Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the
business to address the detrimental effects that the
yogurt-making process may be having on the
environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the
Greek yogurt business have found many methods of
controlling and eliminating most environmental threats.
Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits
of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt [[1]] [[U]]outdo[[/U]] the
potential drawbacks of its production.
[[ ]][1] The main environmental problem caused by the
production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey
as a by-product. [2] Because it requires up to four times
more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek
yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is
difficult to dispose of. [3] To address the problem of
disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid
whey. [4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein
[[2]] [[U]]supplement, and people can make their own
Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.[[/U]]
[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment,
acid-whey runoff [[3]] [[U]]can pollute waterways[[/U]], depleting
the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it
decomposes. [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food
[[4]] [[U]]scientists; and[[/U]] government officials are also
working together to develop additional solutions for
reusing whey. [[5]]
[[ ]][[6]] [[U]]Though these conservation methods can be
costly and time-consuming, they are well worth the
effort.[[/U]] Nutritionists consider Greek yogurt to be a healthy
food: it is an excellent source of calcium and protein,
serves [[7]] [[U]]to be[[/U]] a digestive
aid, and [[8]] [[U]]it contains[[/U]] few
calories in its unsweetened low- and non-fat forms.
Greek yogurt is slightly lower in sugar and carbohydrates
than conventional yogurt is. [[9]] [[U]]Also,[[/U]] because it is more
concentrated, Greek yogurt contains slightly more
protein per serving, thereby helping people stay
[[10]] [[U]]satiated[[/U]] for longer periods of time. These health
benefits have prompted Greek yogurtâ€™s recent surge in
popularity. In fact, Greek yogurt can be found in an
increasing number of products such as snack food and
frozen desserts. Because consumers reap the nutritional
benefits of Greek yogurt and support those who make
and sell [[11]] [[U]]it, therefore farmers[[/U]] and businesses should
continue finding safe and effective methods of producing
the food.
