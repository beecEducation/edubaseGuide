[[B]]Coworking: A Creative Solution[[/B]]


[[ ]]When I left my office job as a website developer at a
small company for a position that allowed me to work
full-time from home, I thought I had it made: I gleefully
traded in my suits and dress shoes for sweatpants and
slippers, my frantic early-morning bagged lunch packing
for a leisurely midday trip to my refrigerator. The novelty
of this comfortable work-from-home life, however,
[[23]] [[U]]soon got worn[[/U]] off quickly. Within a month, I found
myself feeling isolated despite having frequent email and
instant messaging contact with my colleagues. Having
become frustrated trying to solve difficult problems,
[[24]] [[U]]no colleagues were nearby to share ideas.[[/U]] It was
during this time that I read an article [[25]] [[U]]into[[/U]] coworking
spaces.
[[ ]]The article, published by [[I]]Forbes[[/I]] magazine, explained
that coworking spaces are designated locations that, for a
fee, individuals can use to conduct their work. The spaces
are usually stocked with standard office [[26]] [[U]]equipment,
such as[[/U]] photocopiers, printers, and fax machines. [[27]] [[U]]In
these locations, however,[[/U]] the spaces often include small
meeting areas and larger rooms for hosting presentations.
[[28]] [[U]]The cost of launching a new coworking business in
the United States is estimated to be approximately
\$58,000.[[/U]]
[[ ]]What most caught my interest, though, was a
quotation from someone who described coworking
spaces as “melting pots of creativity.” The article refers to
a 2012 survey in which [[29]] [[U]]64 percent of respondents
noted that coworking spaces prevented them from
completing tasks in a given time.[[/U]] The article goes on to
suggest that the most valuable resources provided by
coworking spaces are actually the people [[30]] [[U]]whom use[[/U]]
them.
[[ ]][1] Thus, even though I already had all the
equipment I needed in my home office, I decided to try
using a coworking space in my city. [2] Because I was
specifically interested in coworking’s reported benefits
related to creativity, I chose a facility that offered a bright,
open work area where I wouldn’t be isolated.
[3] Throughout the morning, more people appeared.
[4] Periods of quiet, during which everyone worked
independently, were broken up occasionally with lively
conversation. [[31]]
[[ ]]I liked the experience so much that I now go to the
coworking space a few times a week. Over time, I’ve
gotten to know several of my coworking [[32]] [[U]]colleagues:[[/U]]
another website developer, a graphic designer, a freelance
writer, and several mobile app coders. Even those of us
who work in disparate fields are able to [[33]] [[U]]share advice[[/U]]
and help each other brainstorm. In fact, it’s the diversity
of their talents and experiences that makes my coworking
colleagues so valuable.
