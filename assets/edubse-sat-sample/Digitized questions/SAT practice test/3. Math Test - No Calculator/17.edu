A summer camp counselor wants to find a length, $x$,
in feet, across a lake as represented in the sketch
above. The lengths represented by $AB,EB,BD$, and
$CD$ on the sketch were determined to be $1800$ feet,
$1400$ feet, $700$ feet, and $800$ feet, respectively.
Segments $AC$ and $DE$ intersect at $B$, and $∠AEB$
and $CDB∠$ have the same measure. What is the
value of $x$?
